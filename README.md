Machine learning text recognition in day-to-day situations
When a given car owner wants to leave the car park, they have to go to the ticket machine (or ATVM) and choose their number plate from the list. Right after the payment, the barrier management software receives a signal that the given car can leave the parking lot. When the car approaches the barrier, its license plate is scanned again, and if the scanned number matches the already-paid numbers list–the barrier opens.

This is an example of how machine learning text recognition can be extremely helpful in day-to-day situations. The car owner doesn’t have to worry about a printed ticket and contrive where they should put it not to lose it. Everything happens within the software, and all the driver has to do is pay for their stopover.

ADVANTAGES IN FUTURE : The Future of ORC Technology
According to research published in April 2020 by Transparency Market Research, the global OCR market is predicted to be valued at $51, 527 million by 2030 and to expand at a CAGR of 15.2% from 2020 to 2030.
